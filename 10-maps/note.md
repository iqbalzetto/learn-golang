Maps are Go's built-in associative data type (sometimes called hashes or dicts in other language)

To create an empty map, use the builtin make: 
make(map[key-type]val-type).

Set key/value pairs using typical name[key] = val syntax.

Printing a map with e.g. fmt.Println will show all of the key/value pairs.

Get a value for a key with name[key]
