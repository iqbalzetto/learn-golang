Switch statements express conditionals across many branches

here's a basic switch


you can use commas to separate multiple expressions in the same 
case statement. We use the optional default case in this example as well

switch without an expression is an alternate way to express if/else logic.
Here we also show how the case expressions cana be non-constants

A type switch compares types instead of values. You can use this 
to discover the type of an interface value.
