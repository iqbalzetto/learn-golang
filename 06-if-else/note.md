Here's basic example

you can have an if statement without an else

logical operators like && and || are often useful in conditions

a statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in the current and all subsequent branches

note that you don't need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required

there is no ternary if in Go, so you'll need to use a full if statement even for basic conditions
